| Emoji                   | Translation |
| :---------------------: | ----- |
| :smiley: :heart_eyes:  | I like this!<br />No changes or acknowledgements needed. Just wanted to say well done. |
| :x: :warning: | **Problem**<br />This is **a blocking issue** and requires changes.|
| :wrench: :art: | **Suggestion**<br />Not blocking, but a suggestion or idea for improvement. Feel free to disagree and move on.
| :question: | **Question**<br />Not blocking, but requires an answer by the PR/code author. |
| :pick: | **Nitpick**<br />Changes aren't required, but there are insignificant refactor suggestions such as code formatting, naming, etc. |
| :camping: | **Improve**<br />Not blocking and unrelated to the changes made, but an opportunity to leave things better than we found them. |
